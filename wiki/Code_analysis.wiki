An analysis of the basics of game code and how it might apply to the second bonus world

Basically, every frame in a level has a loop that looks like this:

$0861 JSR $08AF
     $08AF JMP ($006A) // 006A contains a level specific address
     .
     . // do a lot of level specific stuff
     .
$8064 JSR $9662
  $9662 JSR $ED9F 
     .
     .  // do a lot of stuff that is common for every level
     .  
(repeat)

For the prize code, it works like this

(first pass)

$06A5  LDX #$05 

$06A7  CPX $0451 = #$FF //0451 will always be FF at this point

$06AA  BEQ $06AF

$06AC  JSR $ED88   // ED88 is level initialization

after this, 0451 is set to 5, so all subsequent frames will look like this:

  $80AF:6C 6A 00  JMP ($006A) = $06A5  

  $06A5:A2 05     LDX #$05              

  $06A7:EC 51 04  CPX $0451 = #$05     
   
  $06AA:F0 03     BEQ $06AF          
 
  $06AF:A9 00     LDA #$00          
   
  $06B1:85 3F     STA $003F = #$00   
       
  $06B3:A5 FC     LDA $00FC = #$00

  $06B5:C9 02     CMP #$02       

  $06B7:D0 14     BNE $06CD       

  $06CD:4C 35 B5  JMP $B535         
             
  $B535:AD A8 05  LDA $05A8 = #$00   
              
// B535 seems to be the code block for level 6, meaning we need to find a code block for level 7, If we can do that, we will know the JMP instruction for the second code!

  $B549:60        RTS (from $80AF)

$8064:20 62 96  JSR $9662    

Now, the other sections of the code are loaded in different parts of the stages. For example the section after 'gates open' uses $06D8 to $0712
